## ðŸŽ¬ Video Player Emulator

This is a dumb player emulator that does nothing but fires events. This project requires **NodeJS**. The main module returns a factory method for instantiating the player. For starting events flow you need to call `play` method with a playlist:

```javascript
const createPlayer = require('./player');

const player = createPlayer({{
  /* config */
});
player.play([
  { id: 'nature-01-3min', duration: 10000, type: 'video' },
  { id: 'Advertisement', duration: 15000, type: 'ad' },
  { id: 'nature-01-3min', duration: 30000, type: 'video' },
]);
```

The player's factory method can accept optional config object:
| Option\* | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
|`shouldRender`|boolean| when `true` the player will render pseudo video in console |
|`subtitlesShowingMode`| `'frame'` or `'permanent'`| set subtitle render mode, in `'frame'` mode subtitles will be displayed after a `showSubtitles` call and cleared for a next frame, in `'permanent'` mode the same subtitles will be rendered until they're cleared by calling `showSubtitles(null)` or other subtitles are provided.

\*These options are not relevant for the task itself and were implemented only for debugging purposes.

Each playlist item has the following structure:

```typescript
interface PlaylistItem {
  id: string /* id of the clip */;
  duration: number;
  type?: string /* type of the clip, currently this is only video or ad */;
}
```

| `on(event, handler)`       | event: PlaybackEvents, handler: Function | register an event handler for the given type event                                                                   |
